This project was created with [applicationize](https://applicationize.me/now) that creates an extention to make a chrome app. chrome://apps/ [source](https://github.com/eladnava/applicationize)

## What it does out of the box
1) When your setup http://messages.android.com, check the box remember this computer
<br/>and it will remember in the desktop app!
2) As long as the app is active banner alerts will popup!

## What it does not do out of the box:
1) currently is not working for badge notifications.

## Instructions for putting the web-app android messages as a desktop application:
1) at chrome://extensions ensure developer mode is on
2) drag the file [messages.android.com.crx](messages.android.com.crx) from this project into chrome the extension page.

## Coming Soon, 
Will upload it free onto chrome store if not already there. 
Or, recommend the appropriate app if it exists.

3) click advanced, enable notifications.
4) click the button to download the crx file.
